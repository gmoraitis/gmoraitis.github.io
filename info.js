        I embarked on a transformative journey in full-stack development, \
        covering both serverless backend and frontend aspects. \
        I applied my knowledge of Python to automate backend tasks,\
        using AWS Chalice and SQLAlchemy for data transformation, \
        report generation, and database querying. Additionally, I \
        utilized React.js for developing user interfaces, \
        gaining exposure to the entire development lifecycle. \
        To ensure seamless deployment and scalability, \
        I employed containerized solutions using Docker and Kubernetes\
        in a Linux environment. I also implemented security principles\
        following authentication and authorization standards such as \
        OAuth2 and OIDC, using open-source tools like Keycloak. \
        These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in \
        full-stack development and modern, scalable application architectures.'
